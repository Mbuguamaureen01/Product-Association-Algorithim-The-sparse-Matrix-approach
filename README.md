🧠 Product Association Algorithm — The Sparse Matrix Approach
🔍 Overview

This project implements a product association discovery system for retail data, designed to find items that are frequently bought together (e.g., bread + butter, tea + milk).
It is built with:

Python (Pandas, SciPy, Dask) for large-scale data analysis

FastAPI for a lightweight backend API

Streamlit for an interactive user interface

The goal is to help retail teams identify cross-selling opportunities, ensure co-purchased items are in stock during promotions, and support data-driven merchandising decisions.

⚙️ The Sparse Matrix + Cosine Similarity Method

This method represents the relationship between transactions and products as a large, sparse matrix:

	Product A	Product B	Product C	...
Transaction 1	1	1	0	...
Transaction 2	0	1	1	...
Transaction 3	1	0	0	...

Each row corresponds to a transaction, and each column to a product (SKU).
A 1 indicates the product was bought in that transaction.

Then we compute cosine similarity between product vectors to quantify how strongly two products are bought together:

similarity
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
=
𝐴
⋅
𝐵
∣
∣
𝐴
∣
∣
 
∣
∣
𝐵
∣
∣
similarity(A,B)=
∣∣A∣∣∣∣B∣∣
A⋅B
	​


A high similarity score means items frequently co-occur in the same baskets.

Because this matrix is mostly zeros (most transactions include a few of 20,000+ SKUs), we use sparse matrix representations for efficiency — enabling this to scale to millions of transactions.

⚡ Why This Approach?
✅ Strengths

Scalable: Works efficiently with millions of transactions using sparse matrix math.

Interpretable: Similarity scores are easy to understand and visualize (e.g., “Customers who bought X also buy Y”).

Flexible: Works with any transactional structure (TransactionId, ItemNo, etc.) — no need for binary encoding or frequent itemset generation.

Fast: No heavy combinatorial search like Apriori; uses efficient linear algebra operations instead.

⚠️ Limitations

Only captures pairwise relationships (not full itemsets).

Doesn’t consider sequence or context (e.g., time, store layout).

🔬 Comparison with Other Methods
Method	How It Works	Pros	Cons	Best For
Apriori / FP-Growth	Finds frequent itemsets and association rules via support, confidence, lift.	Classical, interpretable.	Slow for large SKUs or millions of transactions; hard to scale.	Small to mid-size datasets.
Sparse Matrix + Cosine Similarity (This)	Measures co-occurrence via vector similarity.	Scalable, simple, fast, easy to visualize.	Captures only pairwise relations.	Large-scale retail data.
Neural Embedding (Word2Vec-like)	Learns vector representations of products by treating transactions as “sentences.”	Captures complex relations (“people who buy A also like B or C”).	Requires large data and training resources. Less transparent.	Enterprise setups (Amazon-style).
🧩 Architecture Overview

1. Data Layer:
Raw POS or ERP exports → cleaned via Pandas/Dask → transaction-product sparse matrix.

2. Analysis Layer:
Sparse matrix similarity computation → product association scores → stored or cached for querying.

3. API Layer (FastAPI):
Provides endpoints like:

GET /recommend/{item_id}


Returns top N co-purchased items for any SKU.

4. UI Layer (Streamlit):
Interactive web dashboard for analysts and category managers to:

Explore product associations visually

Filter by store, date, or product category

Generate campaign insights

💡 Example Use Case

When running a promotion on “Bread”, the system identifies:

Butter (0.86 similarity)

Jam (0.74)

Tea Leaves (0.61)

So the retailer ensures those items are stocked and displayed together to maximize sales lift.

🚀 Why It Matters

This approach brings Amazon-like “Frequently Bought Together” intelligence to any retail business —
without the need for deep learning infrastructure or expensive tools.
